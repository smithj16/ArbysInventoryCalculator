# ArbysInventoryCalculator
This is an updated version of the Arbys Inventory Calculator written in JAVA

/*
    This program calculates Arby's inventory. Each class calculates a part of the inventory and stores the result in a JSON file.
    Each class stores the name of the product, amount of product per case and bag according to the distributor.
    The inventory is calculated by multiplying two arrays. The first array stores the amount of product per case and bag.
    The second array will be filled by the user of the software, collecting the amount of each product by the case, bag and individual item in the restuarant.
    The total amount of product is stored in an array variable named "result".
    Each class contains a result array.
